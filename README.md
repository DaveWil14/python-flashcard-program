# python-flashcard-program
this is a flash card program I made with python 
you can edit it to what you what, I have it setup to go over japanese word at the moment

I made this because I hated quizlet with their unskipable ads in their flash cards
I also tried anki which I hated the spaced repition

# First major update
I changed a few things to make the program more user friendly

-you can now choose what side of the flash card is shown first
-making flashcards you can choose between other json files in the directory, so you can have multiple sets of flashcards
-you can make a new json file in the choosing menu
